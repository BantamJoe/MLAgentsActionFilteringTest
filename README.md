The test was done with simple scenario:


The state will have 2 equaly parts:

part 1. Action Available: 1.0 is valid, 0.0 is invalid

part 2. Correct answer: All is 0.0 and only one correct answer is 1.0 generated randomly


The models.py will have the option to switching: using action filter or not.

This is not include code from https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents
